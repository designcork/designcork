                <h2><i>This Time</i> by Clodagh Caulfield</h2>
                <p>I found Cian at Paprika when I was looking for someone to design a children’s book cover. He quickly worked up four options for me to choose from and he
                    didn’t get precious when I asked for a couple of finicky changes. Actually, he took on a lot
                    more that he originally signed up for because Cian is one of those people: positive,
                    interested and very competent. He researched options around the project and came up
                    with recommendations. He did the formatting. He made practical suggestions on font
                    options and paper choice.</p>            
                <p>I trusted his judgement and when I finally got a copy of my paperback into my hands, it was clear I hadn't been wrong. I would recommend Cian highly
                    for any creative project you have in mind.</p>

                <p>His work was fast, very well explained at each step, tailored to our needs/availability, and perfect finished product.
                    Cian even went beyond and helped us find a platform to print it. I 100% recommend.</p>
